# Project notes

## Git

- The remote is `git@github.com:SmidigBommen/dig-the-tracker.git` and the default branch is `master` (not `main`).
- Always verify the remote is configured (`git remote -v`) before assuming branch names. If no remote is set, check with the user rather than relying on auto-detection.
